# Village Mosters


I didn't hate myself, I spent 2 days modeling and doing the project for this hackathon, I didn't have much time for the extra stuff like the loader...

Description: It is a 3D scene made with Blender, Luma, SvelteKit, and Threlte, claudinary. There will be two stands where users can upload their images. Once the image is uploaded, it will be transformed into the chosen theme, such as vampire or zombie. There are additional elements in the scene, such as graves, pumpkins, trees, zombie hands, and owls, to create a harmonious atmosphere appropriate for the scene. I hope you enjoy my work. Bye!
